## Result Highlights

## Understanding the code
We have given the code in the form of notebooks and are self-explanatory in that the description of each cell is given in the respective notebooks. 
Various evaluation dimensions are below
* Datasets included are CIFAR10 (covers iid and cross-silo FL cases) and FEMNIST (covers non-iid and cross-device FL cases).
* Baseline model poisoning attacks [Fang](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-fang.pdf) and [LIE](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/ec1c59141046cd1866bbbcdfb6ae31d4-Paper.pdf).
* Our state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks: Aggregation-tailored attacks and Aggregation-agnsotic attacks
